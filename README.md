# React Firebase Contact App

This is a React-based contact management app that integrates with Firebase for backend functionality. The application allows users to manage their contacts with ease, leveraging Firebase for real-time updates and persistent storage.

## Features

- **Contact Management**: Add, update, and delete contacts.
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are reflected in real-time thanks to Firebase.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication and database.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **PostCSS**: Tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
- **Autoprefixer**: PostCSS plugin to add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
